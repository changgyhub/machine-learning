# Machine Learning
Analysis and Implementation on Machine Learning Models and Methods for HKU Course COMP3314 by Dr. Li-Yi Wei.

## Introduction
The Exercises include rigurous analysis of certain machine learning models, as well as implementation of them in python (sklearn and keras). View __[Here](https://irsisyphus.github.io/ML-Exercises "Machine Learning Exercises")__ for a user-friendly revision of the course and my work. The original course pages are from [1iyiwei/pyml](https://github.com/1iyiwei/pyml/wiki "1iyiwei/pyml").
